# Verification Code in React.js

This project is done in Next.js (a progressive framework of react.js). Reason behind choosing Next.js instead of original react.js is 
due to the hassle of working with two repositories for server and client and its deployment in two different system. Yes, I could use 
yarn workspace or other mono repo tools but still hosting should be done separately.
